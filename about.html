    <p>
      Hello! My name is <span class="highlight">Crystal Austin</span>, and I am an educator committed to access, equity, and meaningful learning in the school library setting. With over six years of classroom teaching experience, I believe that libraries are <em>more than just a space for books</em>â€”they are hubs for curiosity, creativity, and connection.
    </p>

    <p>
      I have completed practicum hours at both elementary and high school libraries, where I collaborated with students, co-taught lessons, and worked closely with librarians to align library services with school-wide goals. My background in education has helped shape my approach to literacy support, technology integration, and student-centered learning.
    </p>
